### Problem Statement:
College is a period where you learn a lot of new things at once, meet people from all over
the world, and learn how to live independently. However, one area where most
engineering college students fall short is learning about money and the financial world in
general.
Some college students think they are unprepared to manage their own money, and the
others are concerned about having enough money to get through the semester.
Our product aims to solve this problem by providing services such as micro-savings,
personal finance management and financial know-how to the users of the product.


### Feature description:
1) Micro-savings: Think of it as the digital version of a piggy bank. For example,
every time you spend money, the app will round it off to the next nearest 10. The
extra amount will then be automatically put into your digital piggy bank.
For example, if you pay ₹25 for an item then the app will automatically put
₹5 in your piggy bank.
2) Personal expenditure and savings tracker: This feature will show the user their
expenditure habits. This will help the user track their spending and hence become
more aware of their financial situation. The user will also be able to track their
savings and set a goal that they would like to hit before a particular amount of
time.
3) Financial education: Financial education will be compiled together with the latest
news from the finance world. We plan to structure the financial education on the
product in such a way that it takes the form of a story rather than a conventional
boring article about savings etc. We think stories are a better way to teach people
anything!

```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
```bash
npm install
```
