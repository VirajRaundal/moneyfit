# MoneyFit

### Abstract:
The level of knowledge, among teenagers, especially those in college is disappointingly low with only 16.7% on average. This research paper introduces MoneyFit, a platform that aims to tackle this significant problem. MoneyFit utilizes cutting edge technologies like Node.js, React.js and MongoDB to provide user-friendly interfaces specifically designed for new learners.

The platform offers a range of resources on money management, including budgeting, saving and investing. It fills the gap in financial education that currently exists. One notable feature of MoneyFit is its analysis of spending habits, which is displayed through pie charts. This enables users to gain insights into their financial behaviors. By bridging the gap in literacy and promoting financial habits MoneyFit seeks to empower Indian college students with the knowledge and tools they need for a financially stable future.
